    %h1 Rails CRM - Customer Relations Management
    %br
    %p
      Welcome to the new Rails CRM.  There are now two flavors of Rails CRM; basic and advanced.  As I have said before, I want the Rails CRM to be just barely more than bare bones.  I am however continuing to advance Rails CRM to be more than the basic version.
    %p
      Rails CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application. Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.
    %p
      Rails CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS. I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite. I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.
    %p
      The basic version is designed to be used for just one organization at a time but the new version is being designed to be more of a SaaS.

  /     %p
  /       Rails CRM uses Mongodb for its database. You will need to have it installed to use Rails CRM. To install mongocrm, checkout the Mongodb installation information at http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
  /     %h3 RVM
  /     %p
  /       Rails CRM has a .rvmrc file for specifying the Ruby version. If you are not using RVM you should. RVM can be installed at the command line using curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
  /     %h3 Install
  /     %ul
  /       %li
  /         git clone the repository
  /       %li
  /         cd into rails_crm
  /       %li
  /         accept the .rvmrc
  /       %li
  /         gem install bundler
  /       %li
  /         bundle install
  /     %p
  /       Start rails server and go to localhost:3000 and you will see the Rails CRM login page. Just create a user and you are up and running.
