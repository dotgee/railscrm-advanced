      Rails CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application. Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.

      Rails CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS. I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite. I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.

        To try out Rails CRM, login using test@example.com and 'password'.  You will belong to a test organization.

        Rails CRM is totally opensourced.  All code is available on github.
